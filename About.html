    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">About Me</h2>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      I am a <strong>Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)</strong> with strong experience in
      quality engineering, test automation, and firmware validation, working on complex enterprise
      and platform-level systems.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      Over the years, I have contributed to <strong>end-to-end quality assurance</strong> across
      web applications, firmware, and platform components, acting as a
      <strong>quality gatekeeper</strong> for critical releases. My work spans
      test strategy, automation framework design, defect analysis, and release readiness,
      ensuring stable, reliable, and scalable systems.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      I have hands-on expertise in automation using
      <strong>Playwright, Selenium, Robot Framework, and Python</strong>, and have successfully
      reduced manual testing efforts by designing automation solutions integrated into
      <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>. I enjoy improving test processes, increasing coverage,
      and accelerating feedback loops for engineering teams.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      My background includes extensive experience in debugging and triaging complex system issues,
      such as <strong>BSODs, firmware failures, and platform-level logs</strong>, using tools like
      <strong>Windbg, Intel ITP, and NPK</strong>. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams
      to analyze root causes and drive issues to closure with clear, data-backed insights.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      Beyond technical execution, I value <strong>ownership, mentoring, and continuous learning</strong>.
      I enjoy guiding junior engineers, sharing best practices in automation and debugging,
      and staying current with evolving QA and testing methodologies.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal glow">
      I am passionate about building <strong>high-quality, reliable systems</strong> and contributing
      to products where <strong>quality, performance, and user trust</strong> truly matter.
